# How to Deal with Introverts

Charles McGarvey

???
- I work at Bluehost as a software developer.
- I don't really have any background in psychology.
- Most of what I know about how to deal with introverts I learned from how my friends, family, and
  coworkers deal with me.
  - I am an introvert.
  - In other words, I extrospect the actions of others and how they relate to me in order to
    understand my own introspecting nature.
- I'll talk a little bit more about me towards the middle of my presentation.

- How many of you think you're introverted?
- How many of you think you're extroverted?

---

## Agenda

- Answer "What is introversion?"
- Develop an understanding of why people act as they do.
- Learn ways to cope with your own introversion.

## Disclaimers

???
### I like introverts and extroverts equally well.

- I may not give both types equal air time.
- I am an introvert and have that bias.
- I know and respect many extroverts a ton.
- Both different strengths and weaknesses.
- Both complete each other.
- World is completed by having the two types.

Also,

- I will be making some broad generalizations.
- I know not everyone fits in the box I'm going to ascribe to them.
- I otherwise don't actually expect to say anything offensive.

### Introverts are selfish, right?
- Introverts are self-centered, self-occupied, self-obsessed, self-serving selfish people.
- At least we're not usually exhibitionists.
- I think this description is not necessarily unfair. Introverts are kinda selfish.
- At least, I can see why introverts may be perceived as such.
- Why don't introverts speak up and share their ideas during meetings and conversations?
  - Maybe they're not team players?
  - Maybe they're keeping the best ideas for themselves?
  - Maybe they don't like us?
  - Nobody really knows what they're thinking because they never speak up, so it's anybody's best guess.

-The bottom line is that introverts are just hard to work with, right?

- People work in and across businesses by working together.
  - They communicate.
  - Barriers to communication are frustrating because it wastes time.

### Let's continue defining introversion

- How many of you understand what Dilbert is talking about here?
  - Raise of hands -- don't worry, I won't be calling on anyone.

- By the way, those who are fans of Dilbert may have noticed the mouth. Scott Adams usually doesn't
  draw Dilbert with a mouth unless he is eating or in great distress. There are relatively few
  comics of Dilbert with a mouth, and this one has the mouth twice.

## What is introversion?

> The strongest distinguishing characteristic of introverts is their energy source: Introverts draw
> energy from their *internal world* of ideas, emotions, and impressions. They are energy
> conservers. They can be easily overstimulated by the external world, experiencing the
> uncomfortable feeling of "too much." [...] They need to limit their social experiences so they
> don't get drained.
>
> -- Marti Olsen Laney, pg. 19

???
### Better definition

- Nine years ago, read book by Marti Olsen Laney, a doctor of psychology, called "The Introvert
  Advantage"
- This description of introversion resonated with me.
- It's still the way I like to think about introversion, both in an abstract sense as well as in
  practical terms in "managing" my own introversion.

STORY

- I am a team lead at my company.
- That means that get to solve technical problems and write code
- It's also my responsibility to lead, manage, and mentor other developers.
- A lot of my non-coding time is spent in meetings and working with my teammates.
- I help them gain knowledge, and make sure they have what they need to succeed.
- Some days I get to code all day; I lock the door and program! I love those days.
- Other days I'm working with my teammates all day and don't write any code.
- I love those days, too, but there is a huge difference in the level of mental fatigue I feel at
  the end of each type of day.
- On the days that I spend all day working on complex programming problems, I get home and feel great.
- On the days that I spend all day working with people, I'm totally wiped out.
- Can any of you relate to this?

## Introverts and Extroverts

#### There is a biological difference.

???
- I really don't know much about how brains work, but I do understand that personality and
  temperament doesn't come from nowhere. Personality develops, but it's also not something
  completely environmental. Brains of introverts and extroverts actually work slightly differently,
  and it's not a learned difference, it's a biological difference.
  
- The difference may have something to do with neural pathways and neurotransmitters, making
  introverts more sensative to Dopamine and thus more prone to getting overstimulated by less
  stimulus than is required for extroverts.

- I don't know how settled the science is in this regard. Let me just say that according to my
  research and best information right now, there are at least partially understand biological
  differences between introverts and extroverts.

- I bring it up because understanding is the first step to identifying and solving problems.

## Human personality spans many spectrums.

Introversion/extroversion make up one of those spectrums

???
### Another perhaps-obvious point

Human personality spans many spectrums. It isn't black and white. You're not really either an
introvert or an extrovert; you exist somewhere in between.

---

## Differences between Introverts and Extroverts

1. Energy creation
2. Response to stimulation
3. Approach to knowledge and experience

???
### Dr. Laney defined three differences

- Introverts gain energy from inside themselves, by being alone and recharging by themselves ("down
  time") while extroverts gain energy from social interaction and other external stimulii.

- Introverts retreat inwardly from too much stimulation. Extroverts run the risk of being
  *under*stimulated and need to get enough stimulation externally to not get too bored.

- Introverts go for depth of knowledge in particular fields that interest them. Extroverts go for
  a breadth of knowledge, learning perhaps as much information but in more areas.

---

## What *isn't* introversion?

- Abusive nerds on the Internet
- Aspergers
- Autism
- Social awkwardness
- Social anxiety (shyness)*

???
Separate the condition from the apparent or supposed results.

- It's not aspergers or autism.
- Rage quitting and abusive nerds online.
- Social awkwardness.
- Depression, [social] anxiety, stress, shyness, energy level, self esteem.
- Aloofness, selfishness, stuck up, self-absorbed.

There are studies that indicate a positive correlation between introversion and social anxiety. This
may possibly be explained by the fact that extroverts just get more experience talking with people.

Despite introversion not necessarily being associated with these particular conditions, that are
difficult to deal with, introversion by its nature does create a need for some special
consideration within organizations.

## So, how *do* we deal with introverts?

---

class: center, middle

## Ignore them!

???
### Ignore them

- "Ain't nobody got time for that!"
- Introverts are slow and don't communicate very well.
- Maybe don't hire them or just try to avoid them.
- Introversion is not a Title VII protected class.
- I'm not aware of any companies that do or have ever tried to do this.
- This isn't viable for tech companies or any organizations really.
- By some recent studies, as much as 50% of people are introverted.
- How can there be that many introverts? Well, remember that our personality actually exists
  somewhere along a spectrum. Also, many introverts just learn to act like extroverts; from
  a young age they mimic social behavior around them and may never realize they're introverted.

--
No.

???
### Yeah, that's just silly.

---

class: center, middle

## Go all in[troverts]!

???
- So, if we can't ignore them, should we prefer them?

- The trouble with that, is extroverts are valuable. Extroverts have tons of valuable skills.

- Also, there's not a lot of conclusive evidence to suggest that introverts work better with other
  introverts than with extroverts. There may be fewer interpersonal conflicts, but there also can be
  a lot of communication *not* actually happening.

- Extroverts are really good at facilitating conversation.

--
No.

---

class: center, middle

## Learn to get along!

???
- Let's instead keep both introverts and extroverts and instead learn how to communicate and get
  along with each other.

- Then we can keep the advantages of both types!

--
Yes!!

class: my-story

## Dealing with your own Introversion

???
I wouldn't say that my story is unique at all.

I learned of and then became interested in understanding introversion when I was at a point in my
life where I was trying to understand myself. When I was growing up, I was often frustrated that
I wasn't more like my extrovert peers. I enjoyed and had fun with my friends -- fortunately for me,
my friends enjoyed many introverted activities -- but I also enjoyed (read: needed) down time, and
I was ashamed of that difference. That was at least one part of my personality that I identified as
an undesirable trait.

Unfortunately, I often made the mistake of caring what my peers thought of me, because all kids do
care about that, and that had some effect on my self esteem. It was worse than that, though: I made
the far-more foolish mistake of believing in and caring what I *thought* my peers thought of me.

My life experience made me uncomfortable being me, which is awful because I wasn't about to be
anyone else. After I realized how silly I was being by putting so much weight behind what others may
have thought about me, my discomfort left and I was able to be happy again.

--

???
I think this experience, to varying degrees, is shared by many people of a variety of personality
types. If you can relate to the experience I shared and are still clinging to the false idea that
your self-worth should be unhealthily tightly coupled with what others think of you (or what you
imagine others think about you), please let go of that notion! This is the most important thing you
could take away from this presentation.

But don't mistake me: I'm not saying that you should have no care at all for what other people think
of you. That would also be a sad and unfortunate way to live. As with most things, you need
a balance. Caring how others regard you will help you accept criticism when it is founded, and the
balanced perspective will help you reject baseless criticism.

For all the introspecting that introverts are supposed to be doing, they can be really bad at
viewing themselves accurately. Poor self-esteem affects introverts and extroverts alike. It's often
caused by bad assumptions going in, so even introverts can't come to more enlightened conclusions by
themselves. Thoughts like "I am not a good person" attach themselves deeply within the mind, and
once they grab hold they're hard to shake.

So, bottom line: if you are not comfortable in your own skin, make a change. Get a new perspective.
If you are introverted, there are simple things that you can do to "manage" your introversion.

--

- Learn and understand how *you* function.

???
There's no point being an introvert if you're not going to actually introspect, so choose to study
more about how you work. If this presentation is the first time you've learned about introversion,
then this is a good start, but there is a lot more that you can learn about yourself.

--
- Stay on top of your schedule so you don't run out of energy.

???
- If you know you will be around people, compensate be carving out time in your schedule to rest up.
- Try to keep an energy reserve in case you need it for unexpected events.

--
- Know and respect your limits.

???
This one may be a bit controversial, but I think it's true.
- People like to think they're unlimited, but people have limits -- yes, they do -- and it's not bad
  to acknowledge that if you're honest with yourself.
- Don't feel bad by saying "no" to some social events.

--
- Work outside of your "comfort zone" on your terms.

???
Now, I don't particularly like the phrase "comfort zone." It's bandied around constantly, but little
time is spent considering whether or not doing so has real benefits that the any of us should care
about. It may be beneficial, but we all seem to have this assumption that we all should be breaking
out of our comfort zones, but should we really all be striving to do that? Yes and no.

- To the extent that we get personal growth out of stepping outside of our "comfort zones," then it
  is worthwhile.
- To the extent that being outside of our "comfort zones" makes us hate our lives, then it's not
  a good thing.
- So, we should be striving for personal growth, but we can do that growth on our own terms. Usually
  when somebody brings up "comfort zones," it's because they're trying to get you to do something,
  maybe out of good intentions, but you're smart enough to make a conscious decision for yourself
  whether or not stretching yourself at that time will be good for you or not.

???
- This is my favorite introvert.
- There are actually a lot of awesome introverts that have risen to prominence and even become
  role-models to many. I'm not going to talk about them, but it's fun to watch people and look for
  signs that may indicate where they're at on the introversion/extroversion spectrum.
- My favorite example of an introvert is a fictional character. The writers of Star Trek TNG did
  a fantastic job at creating and developing this interesting yet very introverted character. There
  are signs that Sir Patrick Stewart himself may lean toward introversion, and that may be why he
  was also able to play the part so well.
- Anyway, this is Captain Picard putting on a not-entirely-convincing smile for "Captain Picard Day"
  on the Enterprise. His duties on this day include meeting with children on the ship and judging
  their class projects.
- By the way, Captain Picard Day is a real thing, I recently found out. Apparently it's celebrated
  on June 16th of each year.

- How many of you introverts have found yourself in a similar position? Out of energy but still
  putting on a smile at a social event, hoping your smile is at least somewhat convincing?

## Put Into Practice

???
Introverts don't need to be coddled. Certain individuals (introvert or extrovert) may feel they need
that, but introverts don't inherently need that.  In fact that may be very anti-productive. Because
of the energy requirements of introverts, they do need special consideration, that's true. But not
coddling.

These things are meant to create an environment or the right conditions to make it more likely for
introverts to succeed and be happy in the workplace.

Some of these things can simply be added to your processes or routines in order to get the benefit.

However, to the extent that any of these things conflict or interfere with the needs of extroverts
or take away from the conditions that allow extroverts to succeed, some compromise will need to be
reached.

---

## Communication

--
- Let people choose how they communicate with you.

???
Even though an introvert may not be at her best during face-to-face communication, she may do just
fine at other types of communication. Email, intranet chat, things like that are much less
stimulating and give introverts plenty of time to gather their thoughts and formulate proper
responses.

Introverts can be so good at those types of communication, you may not even realize they're
introverted. (Until you meet them face to face. Then it may become painfully obvious. It's like: you
were so articulate and well-spoken in your email, and here you can barely string two sentences
together!)

---

## Meetings

--
- Don't put introverts on the spot.

???
Try not to put introverts "on the spot". You'll likely get either a blank expression in return or
much fumbling of words.

--
- Seed the discussion.

???
- This may be general good advice for anyone leading a meeting.
- Seed the discussion with enough context and detail to make sure everyone is on the same page.

--
- Send out a list of things attendees should think about and plan before the meeting.

--
- Make sure everyone knows what will be expected of them.

???
- Goes back to the idea that introverts don't appreciate being put on the spot.

--
- Encourage introverts to write down their ideas.

???
In a meeting or other social setting, you'll likely find the introverts there may seem to not be
participating. What may be happening is that they may be having deeper thoughts than the extroverts.
This does take time, though, so they're probably lagging behind in the conversation, and by the time
they have something really interesting to say, they may find the conversation topic has moved on, so
they may not ever share their thought.

You can either ask at the end of the meeting if the introverts in the room have anything to add
about anything discussed, or maybe just tell them to email their ideas later, perhaps after they
have had even more processing time.

--
- Leave gaps in your conversation.

???
Introverts don't like to interrupt people, and sometimes extroverts engaging with each other fail to
leave gaps in the conversation in which introverts feel like they can interject. Again, not all
introverts have this issue, and some that do have it have trained themselves to interact more like
extroverts in social settings.

This may not work very well at first, so you may need to experiment and see what works to help your
introvert(s) engage you more in conversation.

--
- Sometimes it's a good thing when introverts don't talk.

???
Introverts don't feel the need to say something unless it's important AND isn't already being said,
so if extroverts happen to be covering all the important points in the conversation well enough,
introverts may be content to sit back and let the extrovert say everything. So, if introverts aren't
talking, that may be a sign that everything is cool.

---

## Deadlines

--
- Don't rush introverts.

???
Don't rush introverts. When you ask them a question that they don't immediately know the answer to,
you may get a blank expression that may make you think that there is no thinking going on there, but
they are thinking.  Just be a little patient and you'll get a response eventually. If you're an
introvert put on the spot, try to make some sort of indication that you are thinking and will
respond. "Give me a second to think about that..."

--
- Limit the number of projects placed on introverts.

???
Introverts can handle complexity, but they do better when they can focus on one or two areas. More
than this, and there is risk that the introvert will become overwhelmed and then be less effective.
So keep the number of projects reduced. Introverts will still do good work on their projects, but
they'll be less likely to feel overburdened.

## Atmosphere

--
- No open office design!

???
- Bad idea, Google!
- It's just a bad fad that needs to go away sooner rather than later.

--
- Reduce stimulation.

--
- If you can, create private cubicles AND a common area for knowledge transfer.

???
Stimulation (note steril slides).

Some introverts may be prone to not remembering "trivial" details... such as
people's names. If you struggle with this, work on it. Sometimes you see
somebody but you just don't care enough to actually see them. Start to care.
